  abstract = {Systems as diverse as genetic networks or the World Wide Web are best described as networks with complex topology. A common property of many large networks is that the vertex connectivities follow a scale-free power-law distribution. This feature was found to be a consequence of two generic mechanisms: (i) networks expand continuously by the addition of new vertices, and (ii) new vertices attach preferentially to sites that are already well connected. A model based on these two ingredients reproduces the observed stationary scale-free distributions, which indicates that the development of large networks is governed by robust self-organizing phenomena that go beyond the particulars of the individual systems.},

However, the universality of scale-free networks remains controversial. Here, we organize different definitions of scale-free networks and construct a severe test of their empirical prevalence using state-of-the-art statistical tools applied to nearly 1000 social, biological, technological, transportation, and information networks. Across these networks, we find robust evidence that strongly scale-free structure is empirically rare, while for most networks, log-normal distributions fit the data as well or better than power laws. Furthermore, social networks are at best weakly scale free, while a handful of technological and biological networks appear strongly scale free. These findings highlight the structural diversity of real-world networks and the need for new theoretical explanations of these non-scale-free patterns.},

In [2] and, with Jeong, in [3], Barab{\'a}si and Albert suggested that after many steps the proportion               P               (               d               ) of vertices with degree               d               should obey a power law               P               (               d               ){$\alpha$}               d               -{$\gamma$}               . They obtained {$\gamma$}=2.9{\textpm}0.1 by experiment and gave a simple heuristic argument suggesting that {$\gamma$}=3. Here we obtain               P               (               d               ) asymptotically for all               d               {$\leq$}               n               1/15               , where               n               is the number of vertices, proving as a consequence that {$\gamma$}=3.{$\quad\copyright$} 2001 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.{$\quad$}Random Struct.
