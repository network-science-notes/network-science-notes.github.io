Very importantly, we pass the graph `G_train` and the community labels `comm_dict_train` as an argument to `compute_features` in order to ensure that things like degree and community structure are calculated using only training data, not testing data.

        "It's important to note that these results have multiple interpretations. Tighter communities could just mean that the platform is better at helping people connect to their interests, and in some cases this might be harmless. On the other hand, such tight communities also smack of echo chambers; in cases related to opinion exchange or debate, it might be difficult for people to actually encounter contrary opinions in this setting. Equality of influence might seem like a good thing, but could also indicate that people with extreme or repugnant viewpoints have become mainstreamed. So, while it's clear that the algorithm has significantly changed the overall structure of the social network, it's important to think critically in context in order to understand whether that's truly a bad thing or not. \n",
