Instead, we'll focus on a modeling question: if we supposed that power laws are present in many real-world systems, how could we explain that? One way to address this question is via mathematical modeling: can we come up with a plausible mathematical model of networks that would reliably generate power-law degree distributions? There have been a number of such models proposed; in these notes we'll discuss a variation on one of the most famous; the Yule-Simon-Price-Barabási-Albert model of *preferential attachment*.

        "After the publication of @barabasiEmergenceScalingRandom1999, there was a proliferation of papers purporting to find power-law degree distributions in empirical networks. For a time, the standard method for estimating the exponent $\\gamma$ was to use the key visual signature of power laws -- power laws are linear on log-log axes. This suggests performing linear regression in log-log space; the slope of the regression line is the estimate of $\\gamma$. This approach, however, is badly flawed: errors can be large, and uncertainty quantification is not reliably available. @clausetPowerLawDistributionsEmpirical2009 discuss this problem in greater detail, and propose an alternative scheme based on maximum likelihood estimation and goodness-of-fit tests. Although the exact maximum-likelihood estimate of $\\gamma$ is the output of a maximization problem and is not available in closed form, the authors supply a relatively accurate approximation: \n",

Supplementary methods such as goodness-of-fit tests are necessary to determine whether a power law is appropriate at all. @clausetPowerLawDistributionsEmpirical2009 give some guidance on such methods as well. \n",

The authors find that that the competing models---especially [lognormal distributions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log-normal_distribution), which also have heavy tails---are often better fits to observed data than power laws.
