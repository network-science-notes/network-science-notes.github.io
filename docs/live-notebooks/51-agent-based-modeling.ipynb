    "# Agent-Based Modeling on Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "Many of the problems that interest us in networks relate to agents making actions or decisions on network structures. While in some cases we can develop relatively complete mathematical descriptions of systems like these, in other cases we need to perform computational simulations and experiments. In this set of notes, we'll focus on basic techniques for *agent-based modeling* (ABM) in Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "In agent-based modeling, we construct a model by defining a set of agents and the rules by which those agents interact. There are many good software packages for agent-based modeling, perhaps the most famous of which is [NetLogo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetLogo). [For even more comparisons, see [this page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_agent-based_modeling_software).]{.aside} In this class, we'll use one of several agent-based modeling frameworks developed for Python, called [mesa](https://mesa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Mesa includes a number of useful tools for constructing, analyzing, and visualizing agent-based models. You can install Mesa using \n",
    "\n",
    "```{bash}\n",
    "pip install mesa\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "at the command line or by searching for and installing it in the Environments tab of Anaconda Navigator. Once you've installed Mesa, you are ready to use its tools. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Components of an Agent-Based Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with some vocabulary. A Mesa model has several components: \n",
    "\n",
    "- An **agent** is a representation of the individuals who make decisions and perform actions. Agents have a `step()` method that describes their behavior. \n",
    "- The **grid** is a representation of relationships between individuals. The grid can be, say, a 2d rectangle, in which case we could imagine it representing space. In this class, we'll of course use a *network grid*, in which we can use a network to specify relationships. \n",
    "- The **data collector** helps us gather data on our simulation. \n",
    "\n",
    "## First Example: Simple Random Walk\n",
    "\n",
    "For our first agent-based model, we are going to code up an agent-based implementation of the simple random walk. There are lots of reasonable ways to do this, and Mesa is actually a bit of overkill for this particular problem. Still, we'll learn some important techniques and concepts along the way. \n",

    "Let's start by importing several tools that we'll use. "

    "\n",
    "- How the model is initialized, via the `__init__()` method. This includes: \n",
    "    - Creating any agents needed. \n",
    "    - Placing those agents on the grid and placing them in the schedule. \n",
    "    - Defining any data collection tools. \n",
    "- What happens in a single time-step of the model, via the `step()` method. \n",
    "\n",
    "The model class actually has a lot more functionality than this. Fortunately, we don't usually need to define this functionality, because the model class we create inherits the needed functionality from `mesa.Model` (which we imported above). Here's our `SRWModel` class. The syntax can look a little complicated whenever we work with a new package, but what's going on is fundamentally pretty simple. We've added annotations next to the most important lines of code; other lines are also necessary for correct functioning but are more boilerplate than informative. "
