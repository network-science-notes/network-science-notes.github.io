The data was collected by @fournet2014contact as part of the [SocioPatterns project](http://www.sociopatterns.org/). Students were given wearable sensors which would ping when two students were in close proximity and facing each other. Each of these pings is an edge in the raw data, although in our processing for this lecture we simplify the data set down so that there is an edge between each pair of students who interacted at all during the data collection period. \n",
