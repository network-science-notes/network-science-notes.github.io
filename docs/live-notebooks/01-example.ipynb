    "Perhaps surprisingly, while it's difficult to prove that there is a giant component, it's not hard at all to estimate its size. \n",

    "\n",
    "Let $S$ be the size of the giant component in an Erdős–Rényi random graph, assuming there is one. Then, $s = S/n$ is the probability that a randomly selected node is in the giant component. Let $u = 1 - s$ be the probability that a given node is *not* in the giant component. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a random node $i$, and ask it the probability that it's in the giant component. Well, one answer to that question is just \"$u$.\" On the other hand, we can *also* answer that question by looking at $i$'s neighbors. If $i$ is not in the giant component, then it can't be connected to any node that is in the giant component. So, for each other node $j\\neq i$, it must be the case that either: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. $i$ is not connected to $j$. This happens with probability $1-p$. \n",
    "2. $i$ is connected to $j$, but $j$ is not in the giant component either. $i$ is connected to $j$ with probability $p$, and $j$ is not in the giant component with probability $u$. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are $n-1$ nodes other than $i$, and so the probability that $i$ is not connected to any other node in the giant component is $(1 - p + pu)^{n-1}$. We therefore have the equation \n",

    "      &= \\left(1 - \\frac{c(1-u)}{n-1}\\right)^{n-1}\\;.\n",
    "\\end{aligned}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "This is a good time to go back to precalculus and remember the limit definition of the function $e^x$:\n",
