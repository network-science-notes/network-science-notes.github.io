    "# Epidemic Models on Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematical models play an important role in understanding the spread of diseases in a population, and are an integral part of informing policies for disease mitigation. The structure of people's contact networks can have a big effect on the way a disease spreads.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Outbreak sizes\n",
    "\n",
    "### The SI model\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we'll model a scenario where individuals can have one of two disease states: *susceptible* (has not yet contracted the disease) and *infectious* (is a carrier of the disease). Suppose we have a network with $N$ agents. We'll denote the number of susceptible individuals at time $t$ as $S(t)$ and the number of infectious agents at time $t$ as $I(t)$. We will make several important simplifying assumptions in our model:\n",
    "\n",
    "- We'll ignore births or deaths in the population, assuming  that these processes happen on slower timescales than the disease spreads.\n",
    "- Because the total population is conserved, and every agent is in one of the two disease states, we have $N = S(t) + I(t).$\n",
    "- Infections can only be transmitted from an infectious individual to a susceptible individual. The probability per unit time that the infection will be transmitted via an edge connecting one susceptible and one infected individual is $\\beta >0$. We call this quantity the **transmission rate** or the **infection rate**. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../assets/img/transmission-rate.png\" alt=\"transmission rate\" width=\"200\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "The model as described above is called an **SI model**. An important question with any model of disease spread is what happens to the size of the outbreak as $t \\to \\infty.$ Let's explore this question now.\n",
    "\n",
    "Start with one infectious node $i$. During a time interval of length $\\Delta t <<1$, the probability of transmitting the disease to a susceptible neighbor (supposing there is one) is $\\beta \\Delta t.$ The probability of *not* transmitting the disease in time interval $\\Delta t$ is $1-\\beta \\Delta t.$ Given a total time $\\tau$, we have\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    \\mathbb{P}(\\text{disease not transmitted after total time } \\tau) = \\lim_{\\Delta t \\to 0} \\left(1 -\\beta \\Delta t\\right)^{\\tau/\\Delta t} = e^{-\\beta \\tau} \\,.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "That is, as $\\tau \\to \\infty$, the probability of the susceptible node remaining uninfected approaches 0. We expect that a susceptible node with an infected neighbor will eventually become infected. Continuing this argument, any node that is path-connected to an infected node will eventually become infected. From this we can conclude that the size of the outbreak will be the size of the component that contains the initially infected node.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, we have already studied the calculation of component sizes (see @sec-component). Consider a network where the fraction of nodes in the giant component is $S$. Then, with probability $S$, the expected size of the outbreak will be $NS.$ With probability $1-S$, the number of infectious individuals will remain small, with the size of the outbreak determined by the size of the connected component containing the initially infectious node.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through this quick analysis, we see that even in the simplest epidemic model, network structure introduces stochasticity into the dynamics. \n",
    "\n",
    "### The SIR model\n",
    "\n",
    "To make the model slightly more realistic, we could assume that agents could eventually recover from the disease, while keeping the other parameters and assumptions as above. We will assume that recovered individuals are no longer infectious (they cannot spread the disease to other agents) and they are also no longer susceptible (they have developed immunity to future infections). Let $R(t)$ denote the class of recovered individuals at time $t$. Now, $N = S(t) + I(t) + R(t).$ This model is called an **SIR model**.\n",
    "\n",
    "As in the SI model, the *transmission probability* between an infectious nodes $i$ and susceptible node $j$ is \n",
    "$$\n",
    "    \\phi_{ij} = 1 - e^{-\\beta \\tau_i} \\,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\tau_i$ is the amount of time that an individual $i$ is infectious. In this case, $\\tau_i$ is a disease-dependent parameter that can be interpreted as a recovery rate. While this value is often chosen to be a fixed constant, we could also draw $\\tau_i$ from a distribution or allow it to depend on other node properties. \n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that we have a key difference in our dynamics due to the introduction of the recovered class. Unlike in the SI model, it is possible for an infectious node to recover before it infects its susceptible neighbors, thus limiting the spread of disease.\n",
    "\n",
    "Intuitively we can see the qualitative effects of our parameters $\\beta$ and $\\tau$. If either (or both) of these parameters are small, then the transmission probability $\\phi$ will also be small. In this regime, we expect the outbreak to reach a limited number of agents and exist only in isolated clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](../assets/img/percolation-example.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "As $\\phi$ increases, we will eventually reach a *percolation transition* where a large \"cluster\" forms, and thus an epidemic (i.e., a large outbreak) is possible. Again, if $S$ is the fraction of nodes in the cluster, the size of the outbreak will be $NS$ will probability $S$. Note that a large value of $\\phi$ doesn't guarantee an epidemic --- this is a stochastic process and it is possible for the disease to die out by chance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### SIR on configuration model networks\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have some intuition behind the effect of parameters in the SIR model, let's calculate the size distribution of the epidemic as well as the epidemic threshold. The mathematical ideas we use in this section come from the study of bond percolation (see @sahimi2023applications).\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have a configuration model with degree distribution $p_k$. We will initially choose one node uniformly at random to be infectious. The transmission probability (as derived in the previous section) will be denoted $\\phi$; we can also think of this as an edge \"occupation\" probability. We will assume that transmission along each edge is independent.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the probability that a node $i$ is connected to a giant percolation cluster (that is, in an epidemic)? It's easier to calculate the expected probability $u$ that a node is {\\em not} connected to the giant percolation cluster via one of its edges, say $(i,j)$. This can happen one of two ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The edge $(i,j)$ is unoccupied (no transmission of infection between $i$ and $j$):\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    \\mathbb{P}(\\text{edge unoccupied}) = 1 - \\phi,.\n",
    "$$\n",
