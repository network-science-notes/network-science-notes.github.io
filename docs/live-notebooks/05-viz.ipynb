    "## Network Drawing as Network Embedding\n",
    "\n",
    "While there are many aspects of network drawing (colors, shapes, etc), we'll focus in these notes on one of the most fundamental ones: where should the nodes be placed? Mathematically, placing the nodes in a graph is equivalent to the following task: \n",
    "\n",
    "> To each node $i \\in N$, assign a vector $\\mathbf{x}_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$. \n",
    "\n",
    "If we collect all the nodes together, we aim to find a *matrix* $\\mathbf{X} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d}$, where $n$ is the number of nodes in the graph, such that the $i$th row of $\\mathbf{X}$ is the vector $\\mathbf{x}_i$ assigned to node $i$. \n",
    "\n",
    "For drawing on a computer screen or chalkboard, $d = 2$. The general task of placing nodes in Euclidean space is often called *graph embedding* (or even more specifically *node embedding*), and has applications in deep learning for much higher values of $d$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this set of notes, we'll motivate and implement two algorithms for performing the embedding task. We'll then discuss some of the significant limitations associated with drawing networks as points connected by line segments, and consider some alternatives. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Spectral Embedding\n",
    "\n",
    "In Section 6.14.2, @newman2018networks gives some heuristic reasons to suggest that our friend the Laplacian matrix might be useful for drawing networks. Specifically, if $\\mathbf{x} \\mathbb{R}$ is a vector giving the locations of nodes on a 1-d interval, the quadratic form $S(\\mathbf{x}) = \\mathbf{x}^T\\mathbf{L}\\mathbf{x}$ defined by the Laplacian matrix $\\mathbf{L}$ is proportional to the sum of squared lengths on this interval. \n",
    "So, we might reasonably expect that minimizing $S(\\mathbf{x})$ in some way will give us a drawing of the network in which edges are short. \n",
    "Since we know that the small eigenvalues of a symmetric matrix are related to the problem of minimizing the quadratic form $S(\\mathbf{x})$, this suggests that finding the small eigenvalues of the Laplacian could be a useful way to proceed. \n",
    "As we've seen before, the Laplacian $\\mathbf{L}$ has a 0 eigenvalue with an eigenvector of all 1's, which doesn't help us much. \n",
    "So, let's consider the *next* smallest eigenvalues. \n",
    "Since we want to draw the network in 2d, we'll take the two smallest eigenvalues of $\\mathbf{L}$, and use their corresponding eigenvectors to give us 2d coordinates for each node. \n",
    "\n",
    "This algorithm is called *Laplacian spectral embedding*. Formally, \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Form the Laplacian matrix $\\mathbf{L} = \\mathbf{D} - \\mathbf{A}$. \n",
    "2. Find the *second* and *third* smallest eigenvalues of the Laplacian.[Recall that, if $G$ is connected, then the very smallest eigenvalue of the Laplacian is always equal to 0 and corresponds to an eigenvector with constant entries.]{.aside}. Let $\\mathbf{v}_2$ and $\\mathbf{v}_3$ be their corresponding eigenvectors.\n",
    "3. Position the nodes in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ according to the values of these eigenvectors: the first coordinate is given by the entries of $\\mathbf{v}_2$, and the second coordinate is given by the entries of $\\mathbf{v}_3$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This elegant algorithm is important enough to be implemented in NetworkX: it's `nx.spectral_layout`. But we can implement a full version (for connected graphs) of it ourselves. "

    "\n",
    "Making attractive visualizations of large networks is a very fun and satisfying thing to do, and some software packages like [Gephi](https://gephi.org/) are specifically designed for this task. We encourage you to put network visualizations on your phone wallpaper, t-shirts, posters, websites, etc. [Indeed, we put a particularly appealing network visualization by HZB's students on our [landing page](index.qmd), and PSC  made a graph visualization as the image background of [his website](https://www.philchodrow.prof/).]{.aside}\n",
    "\n",
    "So, what do we mean when we say that you shouldn't draw networks? In general, it's very difficult to extract reliable structural insights about networks by eye. This means that the one place drawings of networks *usually* don't belong is in scientific papers. It's just too easy for the eye to be drawn to structural features that may or may not actually be present in the data. For this reason, node-edge visualizations of large networks have been called names like \"[ridiculograms](https://petterhol.me/2018/05/28/ridiculograms-a-ridiculous-dialogue/)\" and [hairballs](https://skewed.de/tiago/posts/hairball/) by prominent network scientists. \n",
