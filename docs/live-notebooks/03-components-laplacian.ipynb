    "\n",
    "One of the many important properties of the graph Laplacian is that it describes many *spreading* or *diffusion* processes that take place on networks. Here's an example: suppose that we \"heat up\" a single node on the network, and then allow heat to flow along the network edges. The Laplacian matrix gives a concise description of how this heat spreads over the network. Let $\\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ be the vector whose $i$th entry gives the amount of heat currently on node $i$. Then, the vector $\\delta \\mathbf{x} = -\\mathbf{Lx}$ is proportional to rate of change of heat at each node. If we imagine that heat moves in discrete time, our update would be [One perspective on this update is that it is the gradient flow associated with minimization of the smoothness measure $S(\\mathbf{x})$ from the previous section.]{.aside}\n",
