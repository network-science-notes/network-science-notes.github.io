Notice that $(j, i)$ is represented in the $i$th row and the $j$th column of the adjacency matrix. As with so many things in math, this notation is a choice made for mathematical convenience.

An intuitive way to understand this choice is that, in undirected graphs, every edge \"shows up\" twice in the adjacency matrix, whereas in directed graphs every edge \"shows up\" once.]{.aside}\n",

    "\n",
    "But why stop there? Instead of requiring an integer number of edges between two nodes, we could extend this idea to form **weighted networks** with real-valued edge weights. Sometimes it is useful to represent edges as having a strength, weight, or value. In this situation, we set the value of $A_{ij}$ equal to the weight of the corresponding edge $(j, i)$. For example, weights in an airport network could be used represent a distance between two airports, or weights in a social media network could represent the number of messages sent between two individuals.\n",

    "If you create an edge connecting to a node that's not in your graph yet, the node gets created automatically.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Creating a graph dictionary\n",
