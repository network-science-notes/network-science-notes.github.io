Notice that $(j, i)$ is represented in the $i$th row and the $j$th column of the adjacency matrix. As with so many things in math, this notation is a choice made for mathematical convenience. This choice also allows us to align with both the @newman2018networks textbook and NetworkX syntax. Be aware that different authors and sources might make a different choice!]{.aside}\n",

An intuitive way to understand this choice is that, in undirected graphs, every edge \"shows up\" twice in the adjacency matrix, whereas in directed graphs every edge \"shows up\" once.]{.aside}\n",

Sometimes it is useful to represent edges as having a strength, weight, or value. In this situation, we set the value of $A_{ij}$ equal to the weight of the corresponding edge $(j, i)$.
