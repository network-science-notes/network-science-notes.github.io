    "\n",
    "Many properties of graphs are at least partially determined by the degree sequence of the graph. As we saw in [our discussion of centrality](04-centrality.qmd), for example, the centrality of a node is highly-correlated to its degree. As we'll see later in these notes, the degree sequence also plays a major role in determining whether, for example, an epidemic can spread on a network. On the other hand, not all properties of graphs are so constrained by the degree sequence. For example, when we studied the [structure of empirical networks](07-real-world.qmd), we saw that the density of triangles (as measured by the transitivity) varies strongly between real-world networks and their degree-preserving random counterparts. \n",

    "So, which properties of a graph are controlled by the degree sequence? One way to approach this problem is to study models of random graphs in which the degree sequence is held constant, either exactly or approximately.

    "The friendship paradox has some practical applications in network analysis and interventions. For example, to interrupt the spread of an illness with a limited number of vaccines, it's useful to target high-degree nodes in social networks, as they are more likely to be infected and to infect others. But how to identify the high-degree nodes? The friendship paradox suggests a simple way: pick some people at random and ask them to recommend one of their friends. This is sometimes called *acquaintance immunization* and can be a relative effective strategy for vaccine distribution. See @rosenblatt2020immunization for some discussion of this and related strategies. \n",
