    "Probability is one of the most frequently used mathematical tools in network science. In this appendix, we'll review the most important probability concepts used elsewhere in the notes. \n",

    "## Sample Space and Probability Measure\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll begin with the abstract definition of a discrete probability space as a combination of a discrete sample space and a probability measure. While it's good to know this definition, we'll generally work with a more applied perspective later in this appendix and in the rest of the notes. \n",

    "A discrete sample space $S$ is a set of possible *outcomes*. \"Discrete\" means that $S$ has either finitely many elements or countably infinitely many elements. [The term *countably infinite* means \"as many as there are integers, but less than there are real numbers.\"]{.aside} A subset $A \\subseteq S$ is called an *event*.\n",

    "1. **Nonnegativity**: $\\mathbb{P}(A) \\geq 0$ for all $A \\subset S$.\n",
    "2. **Countable Additivity**: For any countable set $\\{A_i\\}$ of events in $S$ (i.e. $A_i \\subseteq S$), it holds that, if $A_i \\cap A_j = \\emptyset$ for all $i \\neq j$, then $\\mathbb{P}(\\cup_i A_i) = \\sum_i \\mathbb{P}(A_i)$. \n",
