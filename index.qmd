# Welcome {.unnumbered}

This is a set of notes developed for an undergraduate course in network science. The target audience for these notes are undergraduates in mathematics and computer science who have completed courses in linear algebra, discrete mathematics, and programming. 

These notes are a collaborative project between Dr. [Heather Zinn Brooks](https://sites.google.com/g.hmc.edu/hzinnbrooks) (Department of Mathematics, Harvey Mudd College) and Dr. [Phil Chodrow](www.philchodrow.prof) (Department of Computer Science, Middlebury College).







## Pedagogical Features

These notes are explicitly designed for undergraduate instruction with students who are interested in and fluent in both mathematics and computation. For this reason: 

- Computational examples are integrated into the text and shown throughout. 
- Live versions of lecture notes are supplied as Jupyter Notebooks which can be opened in Google Colab. Certain code components have been removed. The purpose is to facilitate live-coding in lectures.
